# MovieDatabase

## Getting Started

### Providing Values for Secrets

You need to add your API key for the [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=de) in the ``.env`` file.
Please rename ``template.env`` to ``.env`` and provide your own API key accordingly.
Afterwards you can run ``ng serve`` to start your development server.

The values of the secrets can be accessed as follows ``process.env["ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_KEY"]``.

### Adding new secrets

If you want to add a new secret, please add the new environment variable in the following files:

* environment.ts
* environment.prod.ts
* .env
* template.env

If you restart your development server now, the environment variable should be accessible in the code.
